## Intro: A Differentiable version of the K-SVD Denoising algorithm

This work considers noise removal from images, focusing on the well known K-SVD denoising algorithm. The approach that was taken here  is to redesign the algorithm to operate in a supervised manner. The implementation is an architecture with the exact K-SVD computational path and with Deep-Learning methods involved.<br />
Citation from the original : Adopting a broader context, this work touches on themes around the design of deep-learning solutions for image processing tasks, while paving a bridge between classic methods and novel deep-learning-based ones. 

## Repository Running Instructions-
1. Clone the repository and open DIP_DeepKSVD.ipynb with google colab notebook (or a local one).<br />
2. Upload all the other files to the same folder and run DIP_DeepKSVD.ipynb (First training section, then loading and testing).
